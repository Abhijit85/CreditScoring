    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      The AI credit scoring application follows a full‑stack architecture in which a React front‑end
      collects user inputs and a FastAPI backend orchestrates scoring, summarization and anomaly
      detection. After submitting their details, applicants receive an estimated credit score and
      personalized feedback.
    </p>
    <h3>Key Features</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>AI‑generated credit score and detailed breakdown</li>
      <li>Interactive user interface with sliders and tabbed navigation</li>
      <li>LLM‑generated risk summaries and actionable suggestions</li>
      <li>Anomaly detection via AWS Fraud Detector or Amazon SageMaker</li>
      <li>Modular FastAPI backend with environment‑driven configuration</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Architecture</h3>
    <p>
      The architectural diagram below illustrates how the components of the system interact. Users
      enter their information in the front‑end, which forwards the data to the FastAPI backend.
      The backend evaluates the data against rule‑based screening logic, computes an initial credit
      score, calls a large language model hosted on AWS Bedrock to produce a risk summary, invokes
      an anomaly detection service if configured, and persists the record in MongoDB.

      This modular design allows the application to run locally or integrate with cloud services
      such as AWS Bedrock, Fraud Detector, SageMaker and MongoDB Atlas.

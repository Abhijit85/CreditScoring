    <h3>Generating Synthetic Credit Data</h3>
    <p>
      The repository includes a Python script that generates a synthetic credit dataset with
      required event metadata. Using the <code>faker</code> library and random sampling, the script
      produces a CSV file with one million rows by default. Each row contains both customer features
      and AWS Fraud Detector metadata columns. The base features include name, age, occupation,
      annual income, monthly in‑hand salary, number of bank accounts, number of credit cards,
      interest rate, number of loans, type of loan(s), days delayed from the due date,
      number of delayed payments, credit mix, outstanding debt, credit utilization ratio,
      credit history age and total EMI per month.
    </p>
    <h3>Rule‑Based Screening</h3>
    <p>
      Before calculating a score, the application evaluates each credit application against a set of
      screening rules. The backend loads rule definitions from a JSON configuration and iterates
      through the rules, checking each condition against the submitted form data. If a rule
      with an action of <code>reject</code> triggers, the API returns a response indicating
      rejection and includes the rule name and description. Otherwise, it records any flags and
      proceeds to compute a provisional score.
    </p>
    <h3>Score Estimation &amp; LLM Summarization</h3>
    <p>
      The FastAPI endpoint calculates a provisional credit score from repayment history, credit
      utilization, outstanding debt and the number of credit inquiries. It then constructs a prompt
      summarizing the applicant’s financial profile and uses AWS Bedrock to generate a succinct
      risk summary via a large language model. The summary is cleaned to remove any follow‑up
      questions before being returned to the user.
    </p>
    <h3>Product Recommendations</h3>
    <p>
      A recommendation service employs a TF‑IDF vectorizer and cosine similarity to compare free‑text
      user queries with a set of pre‑defined credit card products. It returns the titles and
      descriptions of the top matching products to help applicants choose the most suitable
      financial products.
